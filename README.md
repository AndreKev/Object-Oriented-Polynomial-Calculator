Author : NYEMB NDJEM EONE ANDRE KEVIN

# Description
This is an object oriented design of a polynomial calculator implementing usual polynomial operations

# Features
- Multiplatform kernel( asset folder utils ) and windows-tested GUI.
  Tkinter based interface with pillow util for imaging. The Pillow util uses a non system-integrated font for adding text.
- converts an expression in infix notation into a polynomial
- No programming defined restriction on the size of the expression nor the complexity of the operation ( System based )
- Computes integration and differentiation
- Support all usual arithmetic operations on polynomials: exponentiation, multiplication, division, addition, substraction.

# Running the application
On the terminal and parent directory execute : 
python launch.py
